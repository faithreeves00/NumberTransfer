# NumberTransfer
Write a given range of values to a new file

User enters their name, an upper bound, and a lower bound. The program checks a data set file for values within those bounds and then writes them to a new file named after the user. The program tells the what their file is named and what percentage of values were left in the data set file (not written into their file).
